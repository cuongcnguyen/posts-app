# My Result

This repository contains two folders. One named JSAlgorithm is for the JS algorithm questions and the other named react-redux-app is for the post app.

## JSAlgorithm

I named the file according to the purpose of the function. There are two scripts called DisplayStringsWithMostAppearedLength and SumOfTopTwo. Also, there are unit test files as well. I used Jest for unit testing. 

## react-redux-app

The app can handle all the requirements. I used React for UI Components and Redux toolkit for getting and adding posts.
Versions:
npm v10.2.4
node v20.11.1
react 18
